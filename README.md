# LHL Tableau Project - Global Health Trends

## Project/Goals
In this project, I am analyzing the Cause of Death dataset from Our World In Data. This dataset is collection of ways people have died from 1990 to 2019 from diseases, accident, or environmental factors. Datasets such as this are very powerful not only for health agencies, researchers, or governments, but for individuals as well to know what are the major risks depending on the country you live in. The questions I set out to answer are:

1. What are the top causes of death globally?

2. Is the global top cause of death the same for each country?

3. What are the rates of change for different causes of death in different countries?

## Process

### EDA
I began with exploring the dataset by creating mulitple visualizations to gain an understanding of the contents and to begin answering the questions I have.

### Adding in Population Data
After building my initial visualizations, it was clear to me that in order to properly compare countries against each other, I would have to bring in population data in order to perform analyis on a per capita basis. I selected a population estimate dataset from the same website as the source dataset and began comparisons of countries with this lens.

## Results
1. Cardiovascular diseases are the single greatest threat to life and health span based on this data. Adjusted for population, this single factor is the greatest threat to the majority of people in the world.

2. The top causes of death vary drastically between continents.

## Challenges 
The main challenges arise from the understanding that health is a multi-variate issue and the limits of drawing conclusions without enough representative factors. This analysis is limited to the country of an individual, but we know that in reality there are many more factors which influence these results. Factors such as age, sex/gender, economic status, maritial status and many others are influencing factors which need to be accounted for properly.

## Future Goals
To build upon this initial analysis, I would want to include additional influencing factors to assess correlation including:

1. Age
2. Sex/gender information
3. Economic data
4. Maritial status
